# Homework — Dictionaries + Functions + While Loops (Harder Set)

## Task 1 — Dictionary Lookup

Copy this into your file:

```python
capitals = {
    "France": "Paris",
    "Japan": "Tokyo",
    "Brazil": "Brasilia",
    "Egypt": "Cairo",
    "Canada": "Ottawa"
}
```

Ask the user for a country. If it's in the dictionary, print the capital. If not, print "Never heard of it!"

Expected output:

```
Enter a country: Japan
The capital is Tokyo

Enter a country: Mexico
Never heard of it!
```

---

## Task 2 — Wrap it in a Function

Take Task 1 and wrap the lookup logic in a function called `get_capital(country)`. It should return the capital or "Never heard of it!". Call the function and print the result.

---

## Task 3 — Add a While Loop

Now add a while loop around Task 2 so the user can keep entering countries until they type "quit".

Expected output:

```
Enter a country: France
The capital is Paris

Enter a country: Japan
The capital is Tokyo

Enter a country: quit
Goodbye!
```

---

## Task 4 — New Dictionary, Same Pattern

Now do the exact same thing but with this dictionary:

```python
athletes = {
    "LeBron": "Basketball",
    "Messi": "Soccer",
    "Federer": "Tennis",
    "Serena": "Tennis",
    "Bolt": "Track"
}
```

Ask the user for an athlete name and print their sport. Wrap it in a function called `get_sport(name)`. Keep the while loop. Quit on "quit".


## Task 4 — ATM / Bank Accounts
Copy this dictionary into your file:
~~~python
accounts = {
    "alice": 500,
    "bob": 120,
    "carlos": 1000,
    "dana": 45
}
~~~
Build a mini banking system with a while loop menu. The user picks an action: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `balance`, or `quit`.

Write two functions:
- `deposit(username, amount)` — adds money to that account and returns the new balance.
- `withdraw(username, amount)` — subtracts money, but **only if they have enough**. If they don't, return `"Insufficient funds!"` and don't change the balance.

If the username isn't in `accounts`, print `"No such account!"` and skip the action.

Expected output:
~~~
Action (deposit/withdraw/balance/quit): balance
Username: bob
bob's balance is $120
Action (deposit/withdraw/balance/quit): withdraw
Username: bob
Amount: 200
Insufficient funds!
Action (deposit/withdraw/balance/quit): deposit
Username: bob
Amount: 80
bob's new balance is $200
Action (deposit/withdraw/balance/quit): quit
Goodbye!
~~~
💡 Hints:
- Convert the amount to a number with `int(input(...))` or `float(...)`.
- Check `if username in accounts` before doing anything.
- Functions can read and modify `accounts` directly since it's defined above them.

## Task 5 — Video Game Inventory (Nested Dictionaries)
Copy this dictionary into your file:
~~~python
players = {
    "Knight": {"gold": 150, "potions": 3, "level": 12},
    "Mage":   {"gold": 80,  "potions": 7, "level": 15},
    "Rogue":  {"gold": 220, "potions": 1, "level": 10}
}
~~~
This is a **dictionary of dictionaries**. Write a function `get_stat(player, stat)` that returns the value of a stat (like `"gold"` or `"level"`) for a player. Handle two failure cases:
- If the player doesn't exist, return `"No such player!"`
- If the player exists but the stat doesn't, return `"No such stat!"`

Then write a while loop that asks for a player name and a stat, calls `get_stat()`, and prints the result. Quit on `"quit"`.

Expected output:
~~~
Player: Mage
Stat: potions
Mage has 7 potions
Player: Rogue
Stat: gold
Rogue has 220 gold
Player: Wizard
Stat: gold
No such player!
Player: Knight
Stat: mana
No such stat!
Player: quit
Goodbye!
~~~
💡 Hints:
- `players["Mage"]` gives you back a whole inner dictionary.
- `players["Mage"]["potions"]` digs one level deeper.
- Check `if player in players` first, then `if stat in players[player]`.

## Task 6 — Election Vote Counter (+ Find the Winner)
Start with an **empty** dictionary — you're building it as votes come in:
~~~python
votes = {}
~~~
Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a candidate's name (a vote). Each time a name is entered, add 1 to that candidate's count in the `votes` dictionary. If it's a brand new name, start them at 1.

Write a function `find_winner(votes)` that returns the name of the candidate with the most votes.

When the user types `"quit"`, print the full vote tally **and** announce the winner.

Expected output:
~~~
Vote for: Sarah
Vote for: Mike
Vote for: Sarah
Vote for: Sarah
Vote for: Mike
Vote for: quit

Final tally:
  Sarah: 3
  Mike: 2
Winner: Sarah!
Goodbye!
~~~
💡 Hints:
- To count safely: `votes[name] = votes.get(name, 0) + 1`
- To find the winner, loop through the dictionary tracking the highest count and who holds it, OR use `max(votes, key=votes.get)`.
- If `votes` is empty at quit time, print `"No votes cast."` instead of crashing.
